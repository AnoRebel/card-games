/**
 * Offline bot opponent. Deterministic (no Math.random — the app forbids ambient
 * RNG); any tie-break derives from state.version. Three difficulty levels drive
 * how much value-aware strategy is applied:
 *
 *  - easy   → the old behaviour: shed/play the first sensible legal move.
 *  - normal → value-aware: dump high-penalty cards, keep action cards, don't
 *             feed points into opponents' tricks, defend against a low-hand rival.
 *  - hard   → normal + sharper timing (weaponise action cards vs the leader,
 *             hoard trump, lead low early in Albastini).
 *
 * Policies are per-game (keyed off state.gameId) but everything flows through the
 * generic GameModule.getLegalMoves so no engine change is needed.
