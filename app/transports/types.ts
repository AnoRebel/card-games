/**
 * GameTransport — the seam the UI binds to, regardless of offline vs online.
 *
 * The UI never talks to the engine or the network directly: it submits moves
 * and subscribes to redacted state through a transport. LocalTransport runs the
 * engine in-memory (offline); ConduitTransport (Group 6) relays to the
 * server-authoritative state. Same interface ⇒ identical UI for both.
