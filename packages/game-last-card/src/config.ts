/**
 * Last Card variant configuration.
 *
 * The rules of Last Card vary widely by source, so action cards are modelled as
 * toggleable config rather than hardcoded. Defaults reflect this project's
 * ruleset (54-card deck incl. 2 jokers, 7-card hands, 2 = pick up 2, Joker =
 * pick up 5, 7 = skip, 8 = reverse, Jack = suit-change wild).
 *
 * NB: the Joker is represented as rank 0 in `pickupCards` — jokers carry
 * `rank: 0` (see engine-core `joker`/`isJoker`), so a `{ rank: 0, amount }`
 * entry targets them.
